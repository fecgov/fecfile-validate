### Schema Backlog

This directory contains the original output of the bin/generate-starter-schema.py
script. The output *.json files are parsed from the following files contained
in the directory:

- FEC_Format_v8.3.0.1.xlsx
- Form_3X_Receipts_Vendor_10.20.2020.xlsx

The spreadsheets are the result of previous spec work that is now being updated and
ported into the JSON Schema Standard format.

During the process of curating these original output files, each file is copied
up to the ../schema directory where it is vetted and modified as needed. The
original copy of each file is left in this directory for future reference if needed.
