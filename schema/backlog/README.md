### Schema Backlog

This directory contains the original output of the bin/generate-starter-schema.py
script. The output *.json files in this directory are parsed from the following
files also contained in this directory:

- FEC_Format_v8.3.0.1.xlsx
- Form_3X_Receipts_Vendor_10.20.2020.xlsx

The listed spreadsheets are the result of previous spec work that is now being
ported and into the JSON Schema Standard format.

During the process of curating these original output files, each file is copied
up to the ../schema directory where it is vetted and modified as needed. The
original copy of each file is left in this directory for future reference.
