## About this project
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is the independent regulatory agency
charged with administering and enforcing the federal campaign finance law.
The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House,
Senate, Presidency and the Vice Presidency.

This project will provide a web application for filling out FEC campaign
finance information. The project code is distributed across these repositories:
- [fecfile-web-app](https://github.com/fecgov/fecfile-web-app): this is the browser-based front-end developed in Angular
- [fecfile-web-api](https://github.com/fecgov/fecfile-web-api): RESTful endpoint supporting the front-end
- [fecfile-api-proxy](https://github.com/fecgov/fecfile-api-proxy): Reverse proxy for API for IP blocking and rate limiting
- [fecfile-validate](https://github.com/fecgov/fecfile-validate): data validation rules and engine

The FEC validator is designed around the disemination of FEC defined data
specifications using the [JSON Schema Specification](http://json-schema.org/).

The initial baseline spec for the definition of each form item is found in
the FEC Format MS Excel spreadsheet found in the FEC Vendor Pack.
(https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/filing-reports/fecfile-software/)
See bin/generate-starter-schema.py for the script that created the initial
schema definition files that were then manually curated and updated.

The data dictionary can be found in a human-freindly HTML format at:
https://fecgov.github.io/fecfile-validate/

### Custom Validation Algorithms
JSON schema properties with a "fec_" prefix are not part of the JSON Schema Standard
but are custom validation enhancements performed by the FEC validation engine in
addition to the validation performed by the JSON Schema Standard validation tools.

- fec_recommended: Array of properties that if the property listed in the array
is missing a value, the validation passes but with a warning issued about the missing value

## Additional developer notes
This section covers a few topics we think might help developers after setup.

### Register changes to the validation JSON files in the fecfile-web-app and fecfile-web-api repositories
After modified the JSON schema files, those changes must be registered in the [fecfile-web-app](https://github.com/fecgov/fecfile-web-app) and [fecfile-web-api](https://github.com/fecgov/fecfile-web-api) repositories using the hash of the commit of the edits.

In the fecfile-web-app repo:
1) Update the commit hash in the [package.json](https://github.com/fecgov/fecfile-web-app/blob/develop/front-end/package.json) file for the fecfile-validate dependency
2) Remove the package-lock.json file
3) Rebuild the package-lock.json file to commit it to the repo with the "npm install" command

In the fecfile-web-api repo:
1) Update the commit hash for the fecfile-validate dependency in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/fecgov/fecfile-web-api/blob/develop/requirements.txt) file.

### How to update the online documentation
The online documentation for the validation JSON files is hosted on GitHub pages at https://fecgov.github.io/fecfile-validate/
To update this documentation when changes are made to the JSON validation files, we use the [json-schema-for-humans](https://pypi.org/project/json-schema-for-humans/) python package. To generate the documentation, follow these steps:
1) pip install -r requirements.txt
2) cd schema
3) ../bin/generate_schema_docs.sh
